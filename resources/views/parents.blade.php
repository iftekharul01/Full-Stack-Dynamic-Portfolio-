        <p>Parents are a great gift in ones life. I cannot imagine my life without them. They are very loving and care for me always. My father is Md Kamrul Islam and my mother is Mst Saidun Nessa. My father is a Govt. Serviceholder. He is a very kind and hardworking person. He loves me very much and takes care of all my needs. Sometimes he brings beautiful gifts for me. He takes me out and fills my life with happiness and joy. He even teaches me at home and helps me complete my homework. My mother is a Housewife  and is very caring too. She takes great care of the house and cooks tasty food for all of us. My parents always wish that I may be honest, sincere, active, tolerant and polite. They advise us in all respects very much. They pray for me and help me to make my life successful and hopeful. </p>

        <p>I am very dear to my parents. I love and respect them very much too. I do not know what to do without my parents. When I grow up I too will take care of them.</p>
